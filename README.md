# ERAV1 S5 Assignment


## Overview:
This repository contains files for the Pytorch NN model implementation on MNIST Data.

In this Assignment, We have implementation of basic Convolutional Neural Network model using Pytorch on MNIST data.
Repo has 3 files: 
* model.py (script used to define CNN structure)
* utils.py (script used to define functions for train,test and getcorrect prediction count)
* S5.ipnb (Notebook to implement basic CNN using Pytorch on MNIST Dataset)
* README.md (Markup file with description and documentation)

## Usage:

Requried dependencis for implementation :

Pytorch installation
```
pip install torch
```
(Former torch-summary) - API to view the visualization of the model, which is helpful while debugging your network
```
pip install torchinfo
```
Visualization package
```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Data :

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database[1]) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Sample data :
